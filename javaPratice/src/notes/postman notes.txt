:: postman can be used to design, develope and test APIs
:: End Point Request URL can be constructed as below
   Base URL/resource/(Query/Path)Parameters
:: Path Parameters-
   Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path. They are typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection, such as a user identified by ID
   https://www.google.com/Images/1123343
:: Query Parameters-
   Query Parameter is used to sort/filter the resources.
   Query Parameters are identified with '?'
   https://amazon.com/orders?sort_by=2/20/2020
:: limit querry param- to limit the response output
   http://localhost:7070/student/list?programme=Financial Analysis-- lets say it fetches 10 count in response body
   http://localhost:7070/student/list?programme=Financial Analysis&limit=1-- it will fetch just first count in response body
:: Content-Type under header of response specifies the format in which response is obtained like xml, json, etc
:: get-- http request to fetch details
:: head-- http request similar to get, but no response body, just the header info is fetched..a new response header called content length is provided which gives the total length of response 
:: post-- http request to add new details
:: put-- http request to edit existing details
:: patch-- http request to partial edit existing details
:: delete-- http request to delete existing details
:: options-- http request to display all operations that can be performed on a resource under header of response
:: code snippet feature: can be used to translate request into code enforcement of particular format like http, java, python, ruby, etc
:: Presets-- Header presets are used to store commonly used headers key value pairs for a http request like POST, PUT, etc
:: Idempotent-- multiple identical requests has same effect as making a single request.. mostly only POST request is not idempotent, rest all are idempotent
:: Postman Variable-- 
   Global Variable-- present globally with postman, can be used across collections and requests
   Ex- url= localhost:7070
   earlier-- GET (http://localhost:7070/student/list)
   now-- GET ({{url}}/student/list
   
   Collection Variable-- present within the scope of specified collection, for each environment and request of that particular collection

   Environment Variable--specific to an environment
    
   Data Variable-- used for data driven testing and when data is coming from external source
   Local Variable-- scope is limited within a specific request

:: Variable Precedence-- Local(highest)>Data>Environment>Collection>Global
:: Postman Collection-- Collections can be used to storing and organising requests based on functionality	
:: Bulk Import/Export-- Setting_Data
:: Import By copy paste-- Import_RawText
:: Collection Runner: Can be used to run multiple/all requets inside a collection using data, iterations and delay options
:: Postman Interceptor-- It is used to capture requests and cookies made between browser and server (generally shown in network developer console otherwise) and log them under History or any collection in Postman...for that we need to add the interceptor extension and turn it on
:: Postman Proxy-- It is used to capture requests on a particular port and log them under history or any collection
:: How to do data driven operation in Postman(like creating 100 students from single POST request)?
   -- Create the data file in CSV or JSON format
   -- Create a new collection and create the request
   -- In request body, paramterise the value(exactly as mentioned in data file) using data variable in format mentioned below
      {
        "firstName": "{{firstName}}",-- column(firstName) as mentioned in data file
        "lastName": "{{lastName}}",
        "email": "{{email}}"
      }
   -- Now run the collection using Collection Runner
   -- Under Data, add the data file and run the collection
