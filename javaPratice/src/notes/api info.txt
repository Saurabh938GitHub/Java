:: APIs are platform independent
:: What is Web Services? Difference between APIs and Web Services?
   -- Web Services are APIs which use internet while an API may or may not use internet
   -- So, all Web Services are APIs but all APIs are not Web Services
:: HTTP- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
:: HTTP Request/Response parts/contents
   1. Start Line (mandatory)
   -- Request start line contains version, http method, resouces, query/path parameters 
      Ex-- GET /search?q=tuna HTTP/1.1
   -- Response start line we have version, status and code
      Ex-- HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   2. Headers-- Extra information realted to api request and response
   -- Request: Authorization, Cache, Content Type, Content-Length, Host
   -- Response: Cache, Content-Length, Content-Type
   3. Body-- In request body, we have content to make request and in response, we have content about api response
   -- Body content can be data, audio, video, image, etc

:: Idempotence-- result stays same no matter the times request is made
   Except POST, every other http mrethod is Idempotent (safe to repeat)
 
:: REST- Representational State Transfer

:: What is difference between Authentication and Authorization?
   -- Authentication: It means verifying entity's identity
   -- Authorization: It means a entity's access to resources

:: No Auth- Authentication(No), Authorization(No) 
   Basic Auth- Authentication(Yes), Authorization(No) 
   Bearer Token- Authentication(No), Authorization(Yes) 
   OAuth-- Authentication(Yes), Authorization(Yes) 

:: OAuth(Open Authorization) process
   Lets suppose there is a Resource owner with two folders, private and public and server is password protected
   Step1- Client asks Resource Owner for 'Authorization Request' for public folder
   Step2- Resource Owner gives 'Authorization Grant'
   Step3- Client sends 'Authorization Grant' to authorization server for verification
   Step4- Authorization server provides 'Access Token' to client
   Step5- Client sends service request with 'Access Token' to Resource sever
   Step6- Server sends back result in form of response to Client

:: Access Token- It is like client authentication to get protected but authorized resource from server
   Refresh Token- It is used to get a new access token. As access tokens generally have expiry durations
 
:: Nounce- Number used only once
:: Only difference between bearer token and access token is that access token has a time span defined after which it expires.
